# `022` list and tuple

1. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.

## Example input:

+ 34,67,55,33,12,98

## Example output:

+ ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
  ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

## ðŸ’¡ Hints:

+ In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

+ `tuple()` method may be used to convert the list into a tuple
