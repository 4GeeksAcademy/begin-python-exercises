## 📝 Instructions:

1. With a given integral number `n`, write a function `generate_dict` that generates a dictionary that contains `(i, i*i)` that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). 

2. `generate_dict`  should then print the dictionary.

## Example input:

```py
generate_dict(8) 
```

## Example output:

+ {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

## 💡 Hints:

+ In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
